# Readability Problem Set
## Task
The task was to write a program that defines an approximate grade level needed to comprehend a particular text. Those levels are based on the Coleman-Liau index:
> index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8

Here, **L** is an average number of letters per 100 words in a text, while **S** is an average number of sentences per 100 words in the same text.
## Solution
I wrote two solutions in two different languages, C and Python.
