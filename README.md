# Finance Problem Set
## Task
The task was to create a web app that allows users to buy and sell stocks in a testing environment. 
## Solution
Scope of the project is quite standard. While implementing an app, I used:
- Python
- SQL
- HTML
- CSS

Apart from a CSS stylesheet, I used a **Bootstrap** stylesheet as well.

I made a web app in accordance with the **Flask** framework.
