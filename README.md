## Academic Honesty 
I made the repository public for the job-related purposes only. 

If you’re an active CS50 student, I can’t stop you from copy-pasting these solutions into your assignments. However, please remember that this approach will give you guilty conscience rather than relieve. I know, sleepless nights during which you’re trying to find a key to a puzzle are painful, but that’s the only way to improve your skills and gain knowledge.
